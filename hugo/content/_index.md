I created this simple page to contain articles and excerpts which can be refered back to in future. Feel free to ask questions right below each blog post, or send a message via [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirk-sweeney/).

## Topics covered in the realms of:
- Cloud data platforms (Lakehouses, Data-mesh, etc)
- Data Engineering (SQL, Databricks, Synapse, Data Factory, Data Explorer, etc)
- Software Development (Python, C#, etc)
- DevOps workflow (Azure DevOps, Terraform, etc)

## My working principals (based heavily by the agile manifesto)
- To truly be agile we must be customer and people obsessed
- We must work together with our customers to truly understand their problems
- Investing in developer tooling is a necessity to ensure we can continuously release working software
- We should strive to minimize any processes which slow down how quickly we can react to change
- Agile teams must be self-reflective and adapt behaviours to better deliver to our customers
- The best teams are build on a foundation of trust, both within the team and from management

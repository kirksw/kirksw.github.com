Hi I'm Kirk and I build data platforms and data solutions for a living. I built these in all leading cloud platforms, and have worked with a variety of data technologies such as Spark/Databricks, Kafka, Pulsar, Kubernetes, Apache Beam, and many more. I love to learn new things and I created this blog as a place to share some of my learnings. Feel free to ask questions right below each blog post, or send a message via [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirk-sweeney/).

## Topics covered in the realms of

- Data platform paradigms (Lakehouses, Data-mesh, etc)
- Data Engineering (SQL, Spark, Flink, etc)
- Software Development (Python, Java, Rust, etc)
- DevOps workflow (Kubernetes, CICD, Terraform, ArgoCD, etc)

## My working principals

- We must be customer and people obsessed
- To truly understand our customers problems we must be able to work closely with them
- Investing in tooling is a necessity to ensure we can continuously release working software
- We strive to minimize any processes which slow down how quickly we can react to change
- The best teams are build on a foundation of trust, both within the team and from management
